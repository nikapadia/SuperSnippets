# SuperSnippets

SuperSnippets is a tool that takes code and turns it into images worthy of presenting. This project is made using Astro, Svelte, React, Typescript and Bun.

```sh
bun install
```

## Project Structure

Inside project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
