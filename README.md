# SuperSnippets

SuperSnippets is a tool that takes code and turns it into images worthy of presenting. This project is made using React, Tailwind, Typescript and Bun.

## Install Instructions

### Linux and MacOS 
Linux and MacOS users can use [Bun](https://bun.sh/). 
```sh
bun install
```
To run the project, use
```sh
bunx --bun vite
```

### Windows
Windows users could use WSL, but I've found that to be not work at times. For simplicity, use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Linux and MacOS users can also use pnpm if they prefer.
```sh
pnpm install
```
To run the project, use
```sh
pnpm run dev
```
